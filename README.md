# SQL-API
Simple API for creating tables and modifying data inside an SQL Database.
The API is a single class that you can copy and paste into your project with detailed API Notes.
It features:
- Basic Table Creation and SQL Connection
- Data entry and retrieval
- Data creation and deletion

It is exactly what it says it is. Basic SQL API. No complicated procedures you will have to learn/do that on your own time.
But for me, I use it most when I am making programs (simple or complex) that need information stored in an SQL database.
It isn't limited in what you can add to the database, you can put anything that SQL accepts. And on creation of the class you will
already have made the table, connected to the database, and be ready to read/write the data inside the table.
